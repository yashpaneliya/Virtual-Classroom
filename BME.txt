Prime Movers:-
             Prime movers is a device which uses natural sources to convert their energy into mechanical energy useful work.
Pressure:-
Pressure is the property of fluid and it is defined as force per unit area.
		Pressure = Force/Area   or  F/a N/m^2
	the unit of pressure is N/m^2 N/m^2 is known as Pascal(Pa)
			1 Pa= 1 N/m^2.

Efficiency:-
		It is observed that amount of energy supplied to engine or machine is not completly converted into work because some amount of energy is lost due to
fiction and seeveral other reasons. So a fraction of the the energy supplied to engine is converted into useful work.This fraction is called efficiency of the engine.

		     Energy output from engine
	Efficiency = __________________________
		     Energy input to engine

The range of mechanical efficiency for I.C engines is 80-85%.

Power:-
	Power is defined as the rate of doing work OR The power done per unit time.

		power=Joule/second
	The power available at the engine shaft is called Brake power and the power developed by the engine is called Indicated power.
Adiabetic index = Cv/Cp=r^-1
