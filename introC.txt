C LANGUAGE INTRODUCTION:--

C is a procedural programming language. 
It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973. 
It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write operating system. 
The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programming like operating system or compiler development.
Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript and many other languages is mainly based on C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (There are few programs that may compile in C, but not in C++).

BEGINNING WITH C PROGRAMMING:--

1.Structure of a C program:

After the above discussion, we can formally assess the structure of a C program. 
By structure, it is meant that any program can be written in this structure only. 
Writing a C program in any other structure will hence lead to a Compilation Error.
The components of the above structure are:

	1.Header Files Inclusion: 
	 The first and fore most component is the inclusion of the Header files in a C program.
     A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files.

 

Some of C Header files:

stddef.h – Defines several useful types and macros.
stdint.h – Defines exact width integer types.
stdio.h – Defines core input and output functions
stdlib.h – Defines numeric conversion functions, pseudo-random network generator, memory allocation
string.h – Defines string handling functions
math.h – Defines common mathematical functions
Syntax to include a header file in C:

#include <(header_file_name).h>

	2.Main Method Declaration: 
	The next part of a C program is to declare the main() function. 
	The syntax to declare the main function is:
Syntax to Declare main method:

int main()
{}

	3.Variable Declaration: 
	 The next part of any C program is the variable declaration. 
	 It refers to the variables that are to be used in the function. 
	 Please note that in C program, no variable can be used without being declared. 
	 Also in a C program, the variables are to be declared before any operation in the function.
Example:

int main()
{
    int a;
.
.
	4.Body: 
	 Body of a function in C program, refers to the operations that are performed in the functions. 
	 It can be anything like manipulations, searching, sorting, printing, etc.
Example:

int main()
{
    int a;

    printf("%d", a);
.
.
	5.Return Statement: 
	 The last part in any C program is the return statement. 
	 The return statement refers to the returning of the values from a function. 
	 This return statement and return value depend upon the return-type of the function. 
	 For example, if the return type is void, then there will be no return statement. 
	 In any other case, there will be a return statement and the return value will be of the type of the specified return-type.
Example:

int main()
{
    int a;

    printf("%d", a);

    return 0;
}
