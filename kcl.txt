This law is also called Kirchhoff's first law, Kirchhoff's point rule, or Kirchhoff's junction rule (or nodal rule).

This law states that, for any node (junction) in an electrical circuit, 
the sum of currents flowing into that node is equal to the sum of currents flowing out of that node; or equivalently:

The algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a point is zero.

Recalling that current is a signed (positive or negative) quantity reflecting direction towards or away from a node, this principle can be succinctly stated as:
			(I1 + I2 + ... + In)=0
The law is based on the conservation of charge where the charge (measured in coulombs) is the product of the current (in amperes) and the time (in seconds). 
If the net charge in a region is constant, the KCL will hold on the boundaries of the region.
This means that KCL relies on the fact that the net charge in the wires and components is constant.

Limitations:

KCL is dependent on the assumption that the net charge in any wire, junction or lumped component is constant. 
Whenever the electric field between parts of the circuit is non-negligible, 
such as when two wires are capacitively coupled, this may not be the case. 
This occurs in high-frequency AC circuits, where the lumped element model is no longer applicable.
For example, in a transmission line, the charge density in the conductor will constantly be oscillating.
