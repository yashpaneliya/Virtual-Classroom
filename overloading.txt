=>In C++, we can make operators to work for user defined classes. This means C++ has the ability to provide the operators with a special meaning for a data type, this ability is known as operator overloading.

=>For example, we can overload an operator ‘+’ in a class like String so that we can concatenate two strings by just using +.
Other example classes where arithmetic operators may be overloaded are Complex Number, Fractional Number, Big Integer, etc.

=>Operator functions are same as normal functions. The only differences are, name of an operator function is always operator keyword followed by symbol of operator and operator functions are called when the corresponding operator is used.

=>In C++ and Java, functions can not be overloaded if they differ only in the return type.
