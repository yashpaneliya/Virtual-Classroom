This law is also called Kirchhoff's second law, Kirchhoff's loop (or mesh) rule, and Kirchhoff's second rule.

This law states that:

The directed sum of the potential differences (voltages) around any closed loop is zero.

Similarly to KCL, it can be stated as:
	(V1 + V2 + V3 + ... + Vn)=0
	
Limitations:

KVL relies on the fact that the action of time-varying magnetic fields are confined to individual components, such as inductors.
In reality, the induced electric field produced by an inductor is not confined, but the leaked fields are often negligible.
