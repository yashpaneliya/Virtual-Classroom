-->Alternating current:-

Direct current (DC) circuits involve current flowing in one direction. In alternating current (AC) circuits, 
instead of a constant voltage supplied by a battery, the voltage oscillates in a sine wave pattern, varying with time as:

		V = Vosinwt

In a household circuit, the frequency is 60 Hz. 
The angular frequency is related to the frequency, f, by:

		w = 2*3.14*f

Vo represents the maximum voltage, which in a household circuit in North America is about 170 volts. 
We talk of a household voltage of 120 volts, though;
this number is a kind of average value of the voltage. 
The particular averaging method used is something called root mean square 
(square the voltage to make everything positive, find the average, take the square root), or rms. 
Voltages and currents for AC circuits are generally expressed as rms values. 
For a sine wave, the relationship between the peak and the rms average is:

rms value = 0.707 * peak value

-->Alternating current (AC):- 

It is an electric current which periodically reverses direction, 
in contrast to direct current (DC) which flows only in one direction. 
Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, 
and it is the form of electrical energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions, fans and electric lamps 
into a wall socket. A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. 
The abbreviations AC and DC are often used to mean simply alternating and direct, 
as when they modify current or voltage
