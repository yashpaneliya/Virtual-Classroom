                                                          -:PIEZOELECTRIC EFFECT:-

									Piezoelectricity was discovered by two French scientists’ brothers, Jacques and Pierre Curie, in 1880. 
They found out about piezoelectricity after first realizing that pressure applied to quartz or even some certain crystals creates an electrical charge in that certain material.
 They later referred to that strange and scientific phenomenon as the piezoelectric effect.
The Curie brothers soon discovered the inverse piezoelectric effect. It was after they verified that when an electric field was enforced onto crystal leads, it led to 
the malformation or disorder to the crystal lead—now called the inverse piezoelectric effect.
		The term piezoelectricity comes from the Greek word piezo meaning to squeeze or press. Interestingly, electric in Greek means amber. Amber also happened to be 
a source of electrical charge.		
		Many electronic devices today use piezoelectricity. For example, when you use some type of voice-recognition software, or even Siri on your smartphone, the
 microphone that you’re speaking into is probably using piezoelectricity. That piezo crystal turns the sound energy in your voice, and changes it into 
	electrical signals for your computer or your phone to interpret.3 That all becomes possible with piezoelectricity.
The creation of various more-advanced technologies can be traced to discovery of piezoelectricity. For example, the powerful sonar “sonobuoy” small
 sensitive microphones, and the ceramic audio tone transducer, were made possible by piezoelectricity. Today we’re seeing the development of
 ever-more piezoelectric materials and devices.
