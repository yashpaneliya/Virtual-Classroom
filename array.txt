ARRAYS IN C :--

An array is collection of items stored at continuous memory locations.

Why do we need arrays?

We can use normal variables (v1, v2, v3, ..) when we have small number of objects, but if we want to store large number of instances, 
it becomes difficult to manage them with normal variables. The idea of array is to represent many instances in one variable.

We can declare an array by specifying its type and size or by initializing it or by both.

Array declaration by specifying size
// Array declaration by specifying size 
int arr1[10]; 
  
// With recent C/C++ versions, we can also 
// declare an array of user specified size 
int n = 10; 
int arr2[n]; 
Array declaration by initializing elements
// Array declaration by initializing elements 
int arr[] = { 10, 20, 30, 40 } 
  
// Compiler creates an array of size 4. 
// above is same as  "int arr[4] = {10, 20, 30, 40}" 
Array declaration by specifying size and initializing elements
// Array declaration by specifying size and initializing 
// elements 
int arr[6] = { 10, 20, 30, 40 } 
  
// Compiler creates an array of size 6, initializes first 
// 4 elements as specified by user and rest two elements as 0. 
// above is same as  "int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 0, 0}"
